### Executive Summary

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Project Objectives

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- Find predictors of sales price for used cars in Texas
- Construct a ML regression model that accurately predicts sales price
- Complete end-to-end ML project encompassing all phases of DS pipeline
- Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook report
- Create modules as necessary that make my process repeateable
- Include all work in github repo with README to provide high level overview and instructions for replication

#### Conclusions and Takeaways 

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- The best drivers identified were:
    - `back_legroom`
    - `city_fuel_economy`
    - `engine_displacement`
    - `fuel_tank_volume`
    - `height`
    - `highway_fuel_economy`
    - `horsepower`
    - `length`
    - `maximum_seating`
    - `mileage`
    - `wheelbase`
    - `width`
    - `year`

- Best-peforming model outperformed basline by:
    - Having an RMSE value that was 8,713.55 dollars less
    - R^2 improvement over baseline from 0 to 0.87

#### Next Steps and Recommendations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- Try more combinations of categorical features to see if I can optimize performance
- Do more nuanced imputation using means/modes of subgroups instead of just means/modes of whole population
- Try less imputation and see how that affects model performance (drop more nulls)

#### Audience
- Anyone interested in taking a look at my project

#### Project Context
- The full used car dataset I'm using came from Kaggle at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset?select=used_cars_data.csv)

#### Initial Questions

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- Which continuous variables are most related to price?
    - Are these relationships statistically significant?
- Which categorical variables are most related to price?
    - For categorical variables related to price, is there a significant difference in price amongst groups?

#### Formal Hypotheses

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- See notebook for formal hypotheses and statistical testing

### Pipeline Stages Breakdown

---

##### Plan

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- [x] Create README.md with data dictionary, project and business goals, and come up with initial hypotheses.
- [x] Acquire data from Kaggle, save to local .csv and create a function to automate this process. Save the function in an acquire.py file to import into the Final Report Notebook.
- [x] Clean and prepare data. Create a function to automate the process, store the function in a prepare.py module, and prepare data in Final Report Notebook by importing and using the function.
- [x] Clearly define at least two hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed, reject or fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, and document findings and takeaways.
- [x] Establish a baseline accuracy and document well.
- [x] Train several different regression models.
- [x] Evaluate models on train and validate datasets.
- [x] Choose the model with that performs the best and evaluate that single model on the test dataset.
- [x] Document conclusions, takeaways, and next steps in the Final Report Notebook.
- [x] Iterate back through the pipeline imporving each phase as time permits
___

##### Acquire

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- Store functions that are needed to acquire data from Kaggle; make sure the acquire.py module contains the necessary imports to run my code.
- The final function will return a pandas DataFrame.
- Import the acquire function from the acquire.py module and use it to acquire the data in the Final Report Notebook.
- Complete some initial data summarization (`.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape()`, ...).
___

##### Prepare

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- Store functions needed to prepare the data; make sure the module contains the necessary imports to run the code. The final function should do the following:
    - Split the data into train/validate/test.
    - Handle any missing values.
    - Handle erroneous data and/or outliers that need addressing.
    - Encode variables as needed.
    - Identify unit measures and decide how to best scale any numeric data
    - Remove outliers
- Import the prepare function from the prepare.py module and use it to prepare the data in the Final Report Notebook.
- Plot distributions of individual variables.
___

##### Explore

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- Answer key questions, my hypotheses, and figure out the features that can be used in a regression model to best predict the target variable. 
- Run statistical tests in data exploration. Document my hypotheses, set an alpha before running the tests, and document the findings well.
- Create visualizations and run statistical tests that work toward discovering variable relationships (independent with independent and independent with dependent). 
- Summarize my conclusions, provide clear answers to my specific questions, and summarize any takeaways/action plan from the work above.
___

##### Model and Evaluate

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- Establish a baseline accuracy to determine if having a model is better than no model and train and compare at least 4 different models. Document these steps well.
- Train (fit, transform, evaluate) multiple models, varying the algorithm and/or hyperparameters you use.
- Compare evaluation metrics across all the models you train and select the ones you want to evaluate using your validate split.
- Feature Selection (after initial iteration through pipeline): Are there any variables that seem to provide limited to no additional information? If so, remove them.
- Based on the evaluation of the models using the train and validate datasets, choose the best model to try with the test data, once.
- Test the final model on the out-of-sample data (the testing dataset), summarize the performance, interpret and document the results.
